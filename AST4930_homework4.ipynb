To determine accurate planet parameters from transit surveys, accurate stellar parameters are required, because the transit depth only constrains $R_p/R_*$, where $R_p$ and $R_*$ are the planetary and stellar radius. In Van Eylen et al. (2018; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479.4786V/abstract), authors used a sample of exoplanet host stars with parameters homogeneously measured from asteroseismology, which can provide highly precise masses and radii for a sample of bright stars, and determined that the radius valley can be describe by ${\\rm log}_{10} R_p = m{\\rm log}_{10} P + a$, where $m=-0.09^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ and $a=0.37^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$.\n",

In Van Eylen et al. (2018), they took a few different approaches to fit the radius valley. Here, let's use one of the fits from bootstrapping, that is, if a planet's radius and orbital periods satisfy ${\\rm log}_{10} R_p > m{\\rm log}_{10} P + a$, where $m=-0.10$ and $a=0.38$, then we will label them as sub-Neptunes. If ${\\rm log}_{10} R_p \\leq m{\\rm log}_{10} P + a$, where $m=-0.10$ and $a=0.38$, we will label them as super-Earth. Using this criterion, make an array that contains the label (e.g., 0 if sub-Neptune, 1 if super-Earth).\n",
